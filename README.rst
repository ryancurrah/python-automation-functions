Automation functions
====================

This module utilizes two of my other python packages python-bash-client and python-ssh-client.

It is meant to execute commands ona linux system remotely using an account that has sudo su - privleges.

There are a bunch of built in python commands that take in parameters, execute the linux command in a wrapper function and return the result in python.
